# Summary

This project was developed for CS4168 - Data Mining at UL. This project showcases data mining techniques such as EDA, Data Preparation, Clustering, Classification, and Regression.


## Overview

The project delved into the nuances of energy consumption in the steel industry, leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook for analysis. Beginning with thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project unveiled insights into statistical summaries, distribution patterns, correlations, and temporal trends within the dataset. Subsequent data preparation involved a meticulous process of cleaning, formatting, imputation, and transformation to ensure data integrity and usability. Clustering techniques were then applied to identify inherent patterns and groupings within the data, shedding light on potential energy consumption profiles. Classification tasks were undertaken to classify and predict energy consumption behaviour using a variety of classifiers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics. Lastly, regression analysis was employed to model and predict energy consumption trends, providing actionable insights for optimizing energy usage and promoting sustainability in the steel industry. Through this multifaceted approach, the project aimed to unlock valuable insights critical for informed decision-making and operational efficiency improvements.
